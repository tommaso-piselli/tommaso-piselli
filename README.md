## 

I am Tommaso, a Computer Scientist based in Italy. 

I mainly implemented algorithms for visualization during my PhD @ [University of Perugia](https://ing.unipg.it/).

Right now, I am moving away from academia and studying to build a career in Cyber Security, using my acquired knowledge and tools.

My main tech stack is Python, JavaScript (especially with D3), and some C here and there. I also know some rudiments of both Unity and Unreal Engine 4, that I studied for VR and Robotics related problems.

I mainly used GitHubfor private projects. However, there is a repo of which I am pretty proud of: [F$`^2`$Stories](https://github.com/tommaso-piselli/f2stories) (which also got the [Replicability Stamp](https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/#https-github-com-tommaso-piselli-f2stories) by TVCG and was an Honorable Mentioned Paper at [VIS25](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome)).
